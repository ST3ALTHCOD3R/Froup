# Froup
Modern social network platform to interact with friends

This was a project done for COMP 206. Go to http://cgi.cs.mcgill.ca/~rfrati2/ to try out this website where you can make friends and see their recent updates. This was done by group Froup with members Robert Fratila and Miranda LaBrash.
